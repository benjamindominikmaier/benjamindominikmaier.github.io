Phosphorylation forms an important part of the signalling system that cells use for decision making and regulation of processes such as cell division and differentiation. To date, a large portion of identified phosphosites are not known to be targeted by any kinase. At the same time around 30% of kinases have no known target. This knowledge gap stresses the need to make large scale, data-driven computational predictions.

In this study, we have created a machine learning-based model to derive a probabilistic kinase-substrate network from omics datasets. Our methodology displays improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art kinase-substrate prediction methods, and provides predictions for more kinases. Importantly, it better captures new experimentally-identified kinase-substrate relationships. It can therefore allow the improved prioritisation of kinase-substrate pairs for illuminating the dark human cell signalling space.

Our model is integrated into a web server, SELPHI2.0, to allow unbiased analysis of phosphoproteomics data, facilitating the design of downstream experiments to uncover mechanisms of signal transduction across conditions and cellular contexts.
